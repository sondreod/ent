= ENT
Command line tool for simple note taking / worklog.

== Journal
Your journal.ad file is stored at `~/.local/share/ent/journal.ad`

== Usage

`ent` Opens vim in insertmode with a loaded note template. Make your notes and save the file to make a new entry in the journal.

`ent log` Shows timestamp, tags and the first line of all your journal entries.

`ent list` Show all entries in your journal. 

`ent last` Show the last 10 entries of your journal.

`end find <tag_name>` Shows all entries taged with the given <tag_name>

`ent cat` Simply prints the journal file as is. Same as `cat ~/.local/share/ent.journal.ad`

`ent "<your journal entry>"` adds the given entry to your journal. Like `git commit -m "<message>"`. Alltough unlikely, make sure your entry does'nt colide with any command (log, list, last, find, cat or any of their aliases).
